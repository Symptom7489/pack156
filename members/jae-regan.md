Jae Regan is an LGBTQ+ and youth activist in Lafayette and an advocate for Acadiana Democrats. Elected in April of 2024, at 22, Jae became the youngest Chair that the Lafayette DPEC has ever had, as well as the first transgender/non-binary Chair of any in the state. Raised by a single mother in poor economic circumstances, Jae has always had an affinity to fight for and show compassion towards those who come from diverse backgrounds.

As Chair, Jae has set out to build a more active and community-based DPEC to improve turnout amongst low-propensity voters, particularly in the young and BIPOC communities of Lafayette. Jae is also a member of the SLWA LGBTQ+ Archives Advisory Board and is affiliated with many civic organizations in their parish.
