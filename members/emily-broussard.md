Emily Broussard is from Lafayette, Louisiana and is currently serving
 as Scribe for the Democratic Party Executive Committee in Lafayette 
Parish.  She and her husband Sean Richard have two children, Finn and 
Jonah, who spend most of their time stirring up trouble and then being 
too hilarious for anyone to stay angry with them.  Emily has a B. A. in 
English Literature from the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and has
 worked in the field of Risk Management for almost ten years.  Emily is 
an avid reader and an average knitter and enjoys doing both whenever 
possible.

As a Louisiana Democrat, Emily feels that our community members 
deserve safe, free spaces to learn and play and as such is a passionate 
defender of the library (which is where she and her boys can be found on
 Thursday afternoons).  Emily believes that everyone deserves equal 
access to community resources, bodily autonomy free from discrimination,
 and strong representation in government.  Emily loves being a part of a
 big Cajun family and is so inspired by the generations before us who 
came here to live free from prejudice and persecution and helped to make
 it the special, diverse Acadiana we live in today.
